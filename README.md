## PASSGEN: Generate passwords with a single command


### How it works?

`
 ./passgen <INCLUDE-EXTRA?> | <INSENSITIVE?>
`

### Flags:

- `--include-extra`: Add Special characters to password, making it stronger :strong:;

- `--insensitive`: Limits the password to contain only lowercase characters;

The flags can be combined.

### Notes:

- Currently, the generator cannot create dynamic-sized passwords, making only 20 character long.
